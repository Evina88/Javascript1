/*6. Arrays!
6.1 Declare an empty array. Make sure that the name you choose indicates 'plurality', because an array is capable of containing more than one element. (See Naming conventions.)
6.2 Write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of the array is.
6.3 Console.log your array.
6.4 Create an array that has your favorite animals inside (see if you can find a good name that exactly describes what this variable will hold).
6.5 Log your array.
6.6 Add a statement that adds Daan's favorite animal ('baby pig') to the existing array.
6.7 Log your new array!*/

var All=[];
console.log('the value of this array could be everything, it is empty')
console.log(All);

var FavAnimals=["dogs", "cats", "horses", "wolves"];
console.log(FavAnimals);

FavAnimals.push("baby big");
console.log(FavAnimals);
